# Quantum Dots Models Library for DFT Simulations

## Description  
This repository provides a curated collection of **XYZ structures** for various **Quantum Dot (QD) models**, including systems like **CdSe**, **PbSe**, **InP**, **InAs**, and **CsPbBr‚ÇÉ**. These structures are tailored for **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** simulations and other computational studies. The models are provided in standard **XYZ format**, making them easy to integrate with DFT software such as **CP2K**, **AMS**, **Gaussian**, **VASP**, and **Quantum ESPRESSO**.

## Purpose  
This library serves as a reliable resource for researchers and computational scientists working on QD systems. The models can be used for:
- **DFT Simulations**  
- **Electronic Property Analysis**  
- **Structural Optimization**  

## Features  
- üìÅ **Well-Organized Structures**: A diverse set of quantum dot compositions in ready-to-use XYZ format.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Pre-Optimized Models**: All structures are pre-optimized using **DFT** with **CP2K**, ensuring realistic geometries and bandgaps without trap states.  
- ‚öõÔ∏è **Charge-Balanced and Non-Stoichiometric**: Models closely align with experimental conditions, maintaining overall charge neutrality.  
- üß© **Surface Passivation**: Ligands are represented by **Cl atoms** at the surface, compensating for excess charge.  
- üîÑ **Customizable Surface Ligands**: Cl atoms can be replaced with organic ligands using the [Compound Attachment Tool (CAT)](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT), previously developed by our team.
